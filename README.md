- **iex.py** — IEX API data. It parses and emits JSON payloads, structures data with pandas DataFrames and communicates with HTTP services. IEX API.
- **videoToMp3/mp4ToMp3.sh** — It converts media files with FFmpeg.
- **jsonToPanda.py** — Converts JSON to table for readability with pandas api. It structures data with pandas DataFrames. [+] Converts JSON file from IEX API into a table with pandas dataframe api.
- **videoToMp3/webmToMp3.sh** — It converts media files with FFmpeg.
- **reindent.py** — CLI utility to convert indentation widths for a text file. It touches the local filesystem and environment variables. The Reindent class coordinates key routines such as Is Exist, Get Contents and Reindent.
